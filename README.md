# cb-web

Colegio Bilingue React Web App Repository

## Getting started

To get started, in the root of the project run the following commands:

npm install && npm start

Then open http://localhost:3000/ on your web browser.

## Test with Cypress

This project uses Cypress to test end-to-end (e2e) flows, in order to run it, you can run:

npx cypress open --e2e

It should open a new window in which you will be asked which browser you want to use.

Alternatively, there is a script that already does the above and even one that preselects Firefox.
